# Ho_PriceCrawler #

### What is this repository for? ###

The Ho_PriceCrawler module is able to communicate with the [Scrapinghub](http://scrapinghub.com/) tool, which can crawl websites to collect items.  

These items can be imported automatically by this module, and can be matched with the Magento products
in the PriceCrawler product grid.  
This way, price changes and differences of competitors can be easily monitored.

### How do I get set up? ###

Add this module as a submodule to your project,
set up a Scrapinghub account, start scraping websites,
and configure this module.
